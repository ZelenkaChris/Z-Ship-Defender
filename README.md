Welcome to Z Ship Defenders.

Use the arrow keys to fly your Ship around the world to blast away the enemy Ships. You are equipped with an Automatic weapon, use this by holding down the 'C' key on your keyboard. If you get tired of the view, hit the '2' key to have a Behind-The-Ship view, you may revert back to the original view by hitting the '1' key. Increase your score by shooting down enemy Ships and go for the high-score! Refreshing the page is the only way to restart the game.
